# Kards Public Stats

Front end for the Proof of Concept (POC) backend [kards-public-stats](https://github.com/Kards-Stats/kards-public-stats). Also a learning ground for react as i am not a font end developer.

## Setting up

Just run `npm install` then `npm run start:development`

Make sure you have the backend server running on `localhost:4848`
